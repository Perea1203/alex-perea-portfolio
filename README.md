Portfolio created as a student in the edX Coding Bootcamp in April 2024. 

## Description

A portfolio has been designed to showcase the skills I am acquiring and developing through this course. This portfolio will act as a visual storybook for deployed projects, helping potential employers and business partners quickly and succintly identify the highlights of my strongest works available. This portfolio contains Challege 1 which includes HTML and CSS languages. This portfolio also provides a bit of information about me, how to contact me, and a link to my prior experiences before entering the world of software development.
